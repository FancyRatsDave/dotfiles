# Some guidance, but not absolutely necessary:
#
#   * Keep columns 8 tabs apart.
#   * Provide a space after each section.
#   * Underlines are the width of the word.
#   * Try to keep descriptions within a single line.
#
# The cheatsheet will be displayed exactly as you see it here - as a flat text file.
# Comments are ignored, but only if they occupy the entire line on their own -
#  trailing comments are not ignored.
